<h1>Correlation vs Causation</h1>
<p><b>Correlation: </b> is seen when there is a linear relationship between two variables and can be useful in order to talk about how various concepts in the world relate to one another. The strength of correlation can be determined by looking at the value of r. The closer that r is to either 1 or -1 the stronger the relationship is. The r value indicates the closeness of the points to to the trend line.</p>

<p><b>To Note:</b> Correlation is not causation. People are easily convinced that one variable is the direct cause of another when presented a linear correlated model. However, there are oftentimes other factors that can be the cause, and there are even sometimes where two correlated variables have no effect on one another.</p>
    <p><b>Example that correlation is not causation:</b> A research study finds that individuals with cancer that drink orange juice enter remission quicker. The problem with this is that there is little way to know that the cause of this is the orange juice based on this information. For example, it could be that the indivudals that can afford to pay money for orange juice also can afford the better treatments. There are many other factors to consider besides these two, even given their correlation.</p>

<td>A relationship chart is a great way to display two variables that have a correlation. The downside of this chart is that it can be challenging to determine correlation without running randomized controlled experiments. The best way to go about approaching this type of chart is to take into considereration the practicality of one of the variables causing another, the strength of their association, and whether or not there could be an alternative explanation for their connection.</td>    
<td>A frequency chart is a great way to visually depict the shape of data in an easily identifible fashion. These types of charts also make it easier to identify any outliers that might lie within the data set. However, it can be challenging to use this type of chart with complex data sets that include a wide range of variables. In this case, it might be important to break the data up into intervals. </td>
    <td>A time series line chart is one where the x-axis includes equally spaced intervals and the y-axis includes the magnitude of those variables. When reading this type of chart, it is important to consider the seasonality and the trend of it. The trend takes into consideration how the variables behave and the seasonality asks whether the flucations are consistant or not within specific time periods. This chart is not as useful if the time periods for a given set of a data are unclear. </td>
